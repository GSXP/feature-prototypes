Feature Prototypes
------------------

Now that we understand some of the Unity3D basics, it's time to start exploring simple mechanic implementation. For this process, each coder will be tasked with determining the best-practices regarding the incorporation of different features into Sidekick.

**Remember that these concepts have been implemented before!** Start by searching for applicable solutions in the [community resources](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/gsxp-byu-w13/h_UQ0lhcGDU). Once you feel you've a modest grasp on the subject, start to build a prototype that will show off what you've learned.
